# Deploying HAProxy using Kubernetes

HAProxy is an open-source load balancer that can help manage traffic and improve application performance. Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that simplifies the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. By leveraging the benefits of both technologies, we were able to build a scalable and highly available load balancing solution.
